A guide for beginners in software programming, aimed at simplifying the journey I once found challenging. If you're curious about the 'why's,' histories, philosophies and 'how's' of programming, you'll find useful insights here. 
Iâ€™m deeply grateful to those who helped me along the way, and I aim to pay it forward in the same spirit
